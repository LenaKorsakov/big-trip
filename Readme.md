## Big Trip
# OPP-style application written in JavaScript using the MVP pattern.

The app allows the user to easily plan their trip. At each step of the itinerary, the user sees all the information necessary for successful planning: accommodation/transportation costs, description of the waypoint with photos, and the ability to add additional options, such as upgrading the class of transport. All this allows you to focus on planning, and creating a flawless itinerary!

## Description
![When the user starts the application, he immediately sees his planned route. He can select the "future" filter, then only future waypoints will be displayed in relation to the current moment.]
